# Vulnerability-Management-Lab

## Objective

The VM Lab project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for detecting, prioritizing and remediating vulnerabilities. The primary focus was to setup a virtual machine running Metapsloitable 2.0 and running a credentialed scan for vulnerabilities using Nessus Essentials. After the scan is completed, we then gathered the information from the Vulnerability Report to do further prioritization and reporting for remediation. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of Vulnerability Management and its life cycle.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of Vulnerability Management concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and prioritizing vulnerabilities.
- Ability to generate and document reports for further remediation.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

## Steps

STEP I. Open VM and Obtain IP Address

After running the VM and logging in, I simply type in "ifconfig" and hit ENTER. We then I am able to see the IP at the top which is "192.168.1.203"

STEP II. Open terminal on external device to ping target host

The purpose of pinging the host is to see if it's able to communicate with external devices before the scan. With this in mind, I open terminal on our PC and we ping the host by typing "ping 192.168.1.203"

As you can see, the ping was successful and my PC was able to communicate with the target host, indicating it's alive.

STEP III. Create a Credentialed Scan on Nessus

Now here is where this gets most exciting. Now it's time to have to make the credentialed scan using Nessus. First click on "Create new scan" tab on the top right corner of the Nessus menu then click on "Basic Scan" and it should take you to the screen attached below. After that, in the "Targets" tab enter the host IP Address which will be "192.168.1.203". Then name the rest as as needed to, then click "credentials".

Next up is the credentials. Since this is a Linux based host, we set it on SSH. After that, ensure the Authentication method is set to "password". After that is set, enter in the admin user and password. After that is set click "Save" and run the scan.

WHY CREDENTIALS?
- Credentialed scanning involves using privileged credentials to conduct comprehensive vulnerability analysis and obtain accurate results by assessing systems and applications that are typically inaccessible without authentication.
- Uncredentialed scanning offers less precision but can still identify basic vulnerabilities that may be exploitable.
