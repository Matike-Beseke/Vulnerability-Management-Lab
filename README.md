# Vulnerability-Management-Lab

## Objective

The VM Lab project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for detecting, prioritizing and remediating vulnerabilities. The primary focus was to setup a virtual machine running Metapsloitable 2.0 and running a credentialed scan for vulnerabilities using Nessus Essentials. After the scan is completed, we then gathered the information from the Vulnerability Report to do further prioritization and reporting for remediation. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of Vulnerability Management and its life cycle.

### Skills Learned

After running the VM and logging in, we simply type in "ifconfig" and hit ENTER. We then are able to see the IP at the top which is "192.168.1.203"
